Model loading with recursion.
Positions, Normals, TexCoords, ColorAmbient, ColorDiffuse, ColorSpecular, Shininess working well.
Textures diffuse and specular loaded but not sure if specular is working. We won't get to know that with directional lighting.
Have to implement a spotlight scheme that revolves around the model to test - a bit exhausted for that now.
